TODO for A Crude 65816 Emulator

IMMEDIATELY 


SHORT TERM

- Avoid all optimization before we know if we're going to have to rewrite


LONG TERM 

- Add FREEZE/THAW commands to save state of emulator 


NICE TO HAVE 

- Add color output to .STATE, .DIRECT, and .STACK on terminals that support it

- Test to see if Forth's MOVE word is really that much faster than a ?DO loop for the MVP and MVN instructions



QUESTIONS 

- In emulated mode, can REP, PLP, and SEP change the B flag and the unused flag (bit 5) of the status byte (P)?

- If B is clear in emulation mode and we push P to the stack, and then switch to native mode, and then pull P again, will this set XY to 16 bit width (both are bit 3 in the status byte) ? 

- If in native mode the m-flag is set, and we go emulated, will unused bit 5 be set as well?

- How is the b-flag cleared after BRK in emulation mode?


END
