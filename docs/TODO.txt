TODO SHORT TERM

- Code all opcodes before doing anything else
- Avoid all optimization before we know if we're going to have to rewrite


TODO LONG TERM 

- Add FREEZE/THAW commands to save state of emulator to disk


NICE TO HAVE 

- Add color output to .STATE, .DIRECT, and .STACK in terminals that support it


QUESTIONS 

- What happens when D is loaded with a 16-bit value in Emulation Mode? See http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=3459 for details on this discussion.
