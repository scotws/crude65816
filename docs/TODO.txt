IMMEDIATELY 

- Replace PC as A on TOS, completely rewriting the whole code. FML.


SHORT TERM

- Code all opcodes before doing anything else
- Avoid all optimization before we know if we're going to have to rewrite


LONG TERM 

- Add FREEZE/THAW commands to save state of emulator to disk


NICE TO HAVE 

- Add color output to .STATE, .DIRECT, and .STACK in terminals that support it


QUESTIONS 

(Too many to list)

END
