TODO for A Crude 65816 Emulator

TODO SHORT TERM

- Focus is currently on stack
- Code all opcodes before doing anything else
- Avoid all optimization before we know if we're going to have to rewrite


TODO LONG TERM 

- Add FREEZE/THAW commands to save state of emulator to disk


QUESTIONS 

- TSC: We always copy the complete Stack Pointer to the Accumulator, regardless if A is 16 or 8 bits. However, does the N flag react to the 16th or 8th bit, or is it always affected by the 16th bit as well?

- What happens to the LSB of the Stack Pointer during RESET after being in Native Mode? See
