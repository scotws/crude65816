TODO SHORT TERM

- Code all opcodes before doing anything else
- See if we should include PC+1 in next1byte, PC+2 in next2bytes, etc. 


TODO LONG TERM 

- Add FREEZE/THAW commands to save state of emulator to disk


QUESTIONS 

- TSC: We always copy the complete Stack Pointer to the Accumulator, regardless if A is 16 or 8 bits. However, does the N flag react to the 16th or 8th bit, or is it always affected by the 16th bit as well?
